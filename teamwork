# ü§ù Teamwork & Collaboration

- I had a great experience working with my group. Everyone was responsible and made sure all assignments were completed on time. The work distribution for each programming assignment was fair, and each member contributed their part and offered help when needed. We regularly shared ideas and discussed ways to improve our projects, which made the collaboration effective and enjoyable.

- One area that could be improved is communication. There were a few occasions when communication wasn‚Äôt as strong as it could have been, including on my part. However, overall, our teamwork and coordination were solid.

- As a teammate, I believe I was good but not perfect. While I contributed to all projects, my communication could have been better at times, and in one assignment, I struggled and was late adding my part to the project. That experience helped me realize the importance of staying organized and being more proactive in team settings.
