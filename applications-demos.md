## Reflection
- The programming assignments in this course provided hands-on experience applying AI concepts in varied and practical contexts. In PA 1, I explored performance optimization by comparing native Python to NumPy for array operations, which showed how essential it is to use the right tools when building data-intensive AI systems.

- PA 2 introduced me to intelligent agents and the importance of memory in decision-making. By testing a vacuum agent in different environments, I saw how agent design affects efficiency, something highly relevant to robotics and automation systems.

- PA 3 focused on search algorithms and how they perform under constraints. Solving the Missionaries and Cannibals problem and navigating obstacle-filled grids with algorithms like A*, Greedy, BFS, and DFS gave me a strong foundation in how AI tackles problem-solving in real-world domains like navigation, logistics, and game AI.

- In PA 4, I explored local search techniques like Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing to solve the 8 Puzzle and 8 Queens problems. These algorithms helped me understand how randomness, restarts, and gradual cooling can lead to better solutions in complex spaces, similar to real-world scenarios like task scheduling or route planning.h methods like Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing to solve constraint problems. This showed me how randomness and restarts can improve solutions in real-world tasks like scheduling or optimization. 

- PA 5 applied adversarial search to a Dominoes game using Monte Carlo Simulation. Developing AI players in an uncertain and competitive setting helped me understand how AI can be used in games and other environments requiring prediction and strategic planning.

- In PA 6, I explored constraint satisfaction algorithms by solving the Zebra/Einstein puzzle using methods like standard backtracking, forward checking, AC-3 with backtracking, and min-conflicts. This assignment showed me how different strategies handle structured, tightly constrained problems, and emphasized the importance of inference and constraint propagation in reducing search effort and improving efficiency.

- Each assignment showed how AI techniques can solve real-world problems with different levels of complexity, uncertainty, and structure.
