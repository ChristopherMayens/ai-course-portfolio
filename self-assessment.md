# ðŸ§­ Self-Assessment

- Throughout the semester, I feel I achieved the course outcomes to a solid degree. I learned to describe and apply different AI techniques by implementing intelligent agents in various environments, which gave me a clearer understanding of how decision-making strategies affect performance. Designing and testing AI applications was one of my favorite parts of the courseâ€”I enjoyed building agents and comparing algorithm efficiency, which made abstract concepts feel practical and rewarding. Reviewing current AI literature gave me a deeper understanding of the field and encouraged me to think more critically about AIâ€™s ethical and societal impact. Writing essays and preparing demos also helped me improve my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly and professionally.

- In terms of strengths, I feel confident in the coding aspect and in applying AI techniques. My main area for growth is deepening my theoretical understanding, especially when it comes to the different search algorithms. Moving forward, I plan to continue learning about AI and strengthening my problem-solving skills.

-Overall, Iâ€™m satisfied with my performance in the course. I finished the semester with a **final grade of A**, which reflects my consistent effort across assignments, quizzes, essays, and team projects.
