## Performance Summary and Reflections
- In the first partial exam I didn‚Äôt get the grade I was hoping for. The most challenging part was the exercises, and it felt like there wasn‚Äôt enough time to complete both. I got stuck on one of them and struggled with time to finish the one I understood better. For the multiple-choice and short answer questions, I feel like I did okay. Not great, but not bad either.

- The area I need to improve most is solving the 8-queens problem, which took up most of my time and I couldn‚Äôt complete. I also need to strengthen my understanding of different search strategies so I can solve a wider range of problems more efficiently. For the final exam I plan to be better prepared and expect a much better outcome.
