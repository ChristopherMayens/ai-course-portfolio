## Summary of My Performance
- I think my total grade is okay. The chapters where I performed the best were the Agents chapter, the Adversarial Search chapter, and the Constraint Satisfaction Problems chapter. I also did well on quizzes not tied to specific chapters. My weakest chapter was Beyond Classical Search. I also struggled with other evaluations that were from that chapter. Overall, I think I have a decent grade (83.3%), though there’s definitely room for improvement.

## Reflection
- Throughout the semester, the quizzes helped me stay on track with each chapter's material, which made it easier to jump into the programming assignments. They also pushed me to apply what I learned more practically, especially through exercises that connected directly to the concepts.
