# ðŸ“– Course Overview

## Introduction

This portfolio documents my learning, progress, and accomplishments throughout the ICOM5015 Artificial Intelligence course, taught by Dr. JosÃ© Fernando Vega Riveros at the University of Puerto Rico. It includes essays, assignments, exams, reflections, and demonstrations that showcase my understanding of AI techniques and applications.

## Course Outcomes

- **Describe, analyze, and apply different AI techniques in the context of intelligent agents:**  
  This outcome helped me understand the different ways an AI agent can make decisions using various techniques, depending on the problem it is trying to solve and its specific goals.

- **Design and implement an Artificial Intelligence application:**  
  This was my favorite outcome because I got to test the techniques studied in class by designing different agents and evaluating their performance with various algorithms. I was able to see firsthand how certain techniques can improve efficiency when solving the same problem.

- **Review and discuss current AI literature:**  
  This outcome deepened my understanding of how AI has evolved and how it may continue to develop in the future. It also made me realize that AI is far more complex than just a tool for answering questions.

- **Write and present a technical paper and demonstration on an AI topic:**  
  This outcome helped me improve my formal writing and critical thinking skills. I enjoyed researching for the paper and learning about the diverse perspectives of AI experts regarding the future of the field.
