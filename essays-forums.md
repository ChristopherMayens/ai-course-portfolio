## Reflection
- These activities helped me better understand the course material, as they required me to research and consider different perspectives from both AI experts and classmates. They also gave me the opportunity to practice concepts discussed in class, such as the PEAS analysis. The most valuable aspect was how they strengthened my critical thinking skills by encouraging me to analyze and compare diverse viewpoints. Additionally, I gained experience writing formal reports, which will be useful in future courses and professional environments.
